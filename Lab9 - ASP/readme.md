Write a web application for managing vacation destinations. A destination has in the database besides the name of the location (i.e. city etc.), the country name, description, tourist targets in that location an an estimated cost per day. The user can add, delete or modify the destinations and he can also browse the vacation destinations grouped by countries (use AJAX for this). Vacation destination browsing should be paged - destinations are displayed on pages with maximum 4 vacation destinations on a page (you should be able to go to the previous and the next page). 
A login page is also required for authentication. Further client-server interaction will be done via session entries.
